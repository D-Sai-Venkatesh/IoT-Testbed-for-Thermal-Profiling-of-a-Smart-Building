# IoT-Testbed-for-Thermal-Profiling-of-a-Smart-Building

Thermal profiling for a smart building involves mapping the space-time distribution of temperature data. The analytics and data mining for anomalies of this thermal data facilitate many interesting applications like comfort management, fire detection, intrusion detection, occupancy detection etc. In this paper, we present a low cost, open source design for an IoT testbed for thermal profiling of a smart building. Hardware and software required for near real time thermal profiling are described. The deployment and sample results in the form of heat maps generated in near real-time, are also presented.

All information about file structure and how to run, items reuired are described in Temperature Visualization.pdf file in the repo
